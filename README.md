# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree : project 1

### Overview

This project is part of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning nano degree.
For this project, we will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas) in a large, square world generated using the Unity engine.

In this 3D world, a reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

Here is below an animation of a trained agent



The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

0 - move forward.
1 - move backward.
2 - turn left.
3 - turn right.
The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.
